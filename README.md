# Customer & Sales Data Integration

## Overview
Three separate datasets customer info, online transactions, and e-commerce salesâ€”were cleaned, standardized, and integrated into a single dataset. The transformation unlocks the ability to analyze customer behavior, spending patterns, product performance, and revenue trends across channels.

## Datasets
The project uses three datasets from Kaggle:

1. [Customer Info Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishikumarrajvansh/marketing-insights-for-e-commerce-company?select=CustomersData.xlsx)
2. [Online Transactions Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishikumarrajvansh/marketing-insights-for-e-commerce-company?select=Online_Sales.csv)
3. [E-commerce Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data)


## Key Highlights
- Unified view of all customer transactions
- Derived metrics like total orders, total quantity, total spent, average order value, and total revenue
- Ready for analysis, dashboards, and predictive modeling

## Tech Stack
- Python (pandas, numpy)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage
1. Load the three datasets
2. Clean and standardize columns
3. Merge into one integrated dataset
4. Compute metrics and start deep analysis
